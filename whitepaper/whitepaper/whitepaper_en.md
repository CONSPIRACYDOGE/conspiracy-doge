CONSPIRACY DOGE (CSP-DOGE)
Technical Whitepaper

Version 1.0

1. Abstract

Conspiracy Doge (CSP-DOGE) is a deflationary BEP-20/ERC-20 compatible token designed with a structured tax system and a strategic external asset burn mechanism focused on Dogecoin.

The protocol integrates:

Transaction-based fee allocation

Automated liquidity reinforcement

Treasury-based operational funding

External asset burn allocation logic

On-chain transparency tracking

Web3 integration architecture

The objective is to combine deflationary pressure with ecosystem sustainability and measurable burn metrics.



2. Blockchain & Standards

Network (planned): BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
Standard: BEP-20
EVM Compatible: Yes
Upgradeable: No (ownership renounced post-stability phase)
Mint Function: Disabled after deployment
Max Supply: Fixed



3. Token Specifications

Token Name: Conspiracy Doge
Symbol: CSP-DOGE
Decimals: 18
Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 CDS
Minting: Disabled
Burnable: Yes (internal + external burn model)



4. Supply Allocation Model

Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 CDS

Proposed Distribution:

40% – Initial Liquidity & Market Stability
25% – Community Incentives / Staking Pool
20% – Treasury & Strategic Operations
10% – External Burn Reserve (Dogecoin burn program)
5% – Core Team (Vested, time-locked)

All non-liquidity allocations will be transparently disclosed with wallet addresses.



5. Tax Architecture
Buy Tax – 5%

2% – Marketing & Ecosystem Expansion
1% – Liquidity Reinforcement
2% – Strategic Burn Allocation

Sell Tax – 7%

3% – Marketing
1% – Liquidity
3% – Strategic Burn Allocation

Taxes are adjustable within capped limits (maximum combined cap: 10%) during the initial stabilization phase only.

Post-stabilization:

Ownership renounced

Tax parameters locked

6. Liquidity Mechanism

Liquidity fees collected are:

Accumulated in contract

Swapped partially to base pair token (BNB)

Added to liquidity pool

LP tokens locked for a predefined period

This ensures:

Reduced volatility

Increased price floor stability

Long-term pool sustainability



7. External Burn Engine (Dogecoin Burn Model)

Conspiracy Doge introduces a structured allocation mechanism toward Dogecoin burn events.

Mechanism:

A percentage of tax revenue is allocated to burn reserve.

Reserve funds are  converted AUTOMATICALLY.

Dogecoin is purchased and sent to a verified irrecoverable address.

Transaction hash is publicly disclosed.

Burn counter updates via on-chain verification.

This creates measurable external impact without altering CDS supply directly beyond internal burns.



8. Internal Burn Model

The protocol supports:

Manual burn (strategic events)

Automatic burn from reserve

Milestone-triggered burn releases

Burn transparency tools:

Public wallet disclosure

Real-time burn dashboard

Archived transaction logs



9. Treasury System

Treasury wallet will be:

Multi-signature controlled 

Publicly disclosed

Auditable

Treasury funds used for:

Marketing campaigns

Partnerships

Exchange listing fees

Development costs

External burn purchases



10. Security Framework

Smart Contract Protections:

Anti-whale limit (adjustable during early phase)

Max transaction limit (initial)

Cooldown optional (if required)

Blacklist disabled after fair launch stabilization

Ownership renouncement (post-phase 1)

Audit Plan:

Independent third-party audit

Open-source contract publication

Public audit report disclosure



11. Governance Roadmap (Future Phase)

Governance may include:

Burn frequency voting

Treasury allocation proposals

Tax adjustment voting (if ownership not renounced)

Narrative event selection

Governance implementation dependent on DAO transition stage.



12. Transparency & Reporting

The project will provide:

Public treasury wallet

Public burn wallet

Monthly allocation reports

Real-time burn counter

Liquidity lock verification link



13. Risk Considerations

Market volatility risk

Regulatory risk

Liquidity risk

Smart contract risk

External asset burn dependency risk

Participants are advised to conduct independent research.



14. Compliance Positioning

Conspiracy Doge:

Does not represent equity

Does not promise returns

Operates as a utility token

Provides burn transparency rather than profit guarantees



15. Conclusion

Conspiracy Doge introduces a structured deflationary token model combined with a measurable external burn mechanism and transparent treasury operations.

The architecture prioritizes:

Sustainability

Transparency

Measurable on-chain activity

Controlled tokenomics
